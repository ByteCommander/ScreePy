# ScreePy
A free small open-source variant of [screeps.com](http://screeps.com) that uses Python 3 to be hosted on private home servers.

*This project is still in its early development phase, there are no working examples yet. Please be patient.*

##Important stuff that needs to be implemented:

- efficient database storage with intelligent caching of frequently used data
- safe player script execution in a protected environment limited to a small set of possible imports and without any chance to perform any disk or network I/O or modify the system
- way to determine and limit maximum execution CPU time per player script per game tick
- more to come...
